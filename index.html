    <h2>Art Movements</h2>
      <details>
        <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-plus"></i>Realism</summary>
          <p>Realism emerged in the 19th century as a reaction against romanticism, aiming to depict subjects truthfully and accurately. Artists focused on portraying everyday life with meticulous detail, often highlighting the beauty of ordinary objects and scenes.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-plus"></i> Impressionism</summary>
          <p> Impressionism, born in the late 19th century, sought to capture fleeting moments and sensations through the use of vibrant colors and loose brushstrokes. Artists aimed to convey the essence of a scene rather than its precise details, often painting en plein air to capture the effects of light and atmosphere.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-plus"></i> Surrealism</summary>
        <p> Surrealism, a 20th-century movement, sought to explore the subconscious mind through dreamlike imagery and unexpected juxtapositions. Artists often used irrational and fantastic elements to challenge conventional reality and provoke emotional responses from viewers.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-plus"></i> Abstract Expressionism</summary>
        <p>Abstract Expressionism emerged in the mid-20th century in New York City, emphasizing the spontaneous expression of emotion through abstract forms. Artists often used large-scale canvases and gestural brushwork to create works that were deeply personal and expressive.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-plus"></i> Cubism</summary>
        <p>Cubism, pioneered by Picasso and Braque in the early 20th century, revolutionized the way artists depicted reality. Characterized by its use of geometric shapes and multiple viewpoints, Cubist art sought to depict the subject from all angles, breaking it down into its basic forms.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-plus"></i> Pop Art</summary>
        <p>Pop Art, a movement that emerged in the 1950s and 1960s, celebrated popular culture and consumerism through the use of imagery from advertising, comic books, and mass media. Artists often employed bright colors and bold graphics to create works that were both visually striking and culturally relevant.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-plus"></i> Minimalism</summary>
        <p>Minimalism, which emerged in the 1960s, sought to strip away all non-essential elements in art, focusing instead on simplicity and purity of form. Artists often used geometric shapes, industrial materials, and monochromatic color schemes to create works that were visually impactful in their simplicity.</p>
